# Maxwell's Demon Game (WIP)

You play as [Maxwell's Demon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon), a tiny creature (who hates entropy, and don't we all?) that can open and close a door between two chambers. The chambers are filled with gas particles that initialize with a random speed and direction. The goal is to separate the particles by speed.

# Running it

It's written in Rust using bevy. If you have cargo installed you should be able to just run `cargo run` in the root directory.
